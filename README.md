E:D RPi Companion
============
The **E:D RPi Companion** is yet another tool for Elite Dangerous.
This time, it's an information provider, no collecting data and sending to services.
It's main scope is to provide **YOU** with the information you need ingame, like
"Where is the nearest conflict zone?" or "Where can I do that grind?" etc.

With the help of services like INARA.CZ it gives you quick and handy informations.

Originally made for the use of a Raspberry + Toucscreen, it's also available to android devices
